# What is Galaxy?

**Galaxy** is one of the most popular multi-purpose bioinformatics platforms. Originally built as a tool for researchers without programming experience, **Galaxy** started as a platform with an emphasis on simplicity that offered data search and manipulation options, bioinformatics tools, and the possibility of easily combining different analyses thanks to an element called the "History" which allowed the storage of every interme-diate result (Giardine, et al., 2005).<br><br>
Soon after, it was clear that **Galaxy** offered more than simplicity and quickly became one of the best examples of a platform for transparency and reproducibility of full computational analyses for biologists and bioinformaticians (Goecks, et al., 2010).<br><br>
More recently, **Galaxy** has evolved into an open environment that facilitates the development of independent and specialized Galaxy instances and servers, as well as the wrapping of multiple bioinformatics packages or libraries inside the Galaxy framework to take advantage of its simplicity, transparency, and reproducibility. Due to that, a vast ecosystem of **Galaxy** servers [https://galaxyproject.org/use/] and individual tools [https://galaxyproject.org/toolshed/] has been built, which nowadays includes Galaxy tools for the most common tasks found in Bioinformatics.
